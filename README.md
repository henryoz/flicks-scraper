# flicks-scraper
A simple scraping script to (hopefully) gather data on the venerable 20th Century Flicks' catalogue. Not 100% sure what I want to do with it yet but a few ideas are:
- data visualisation (breakdown of number of films by genre, year, RT score, Nic Cage appearances etc.
- Netflix-esque (InterNetFlicks: please don't sue! edition) personal queue management and recommendations (poss. a chance to dick around with Elasticsearch a bit more)
- film discovery journey: pick a film you've seen and traverse the Flicks catalogue based on relevant metadata (or Bacon score?)

The possibilities are endless!

My time and energy are not.
